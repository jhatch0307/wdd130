      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the World Through Your Eyes! Begin documenting your personal journey here. Now you can easily reflect on and display your fun adventures with just a few clicks. Start by selecting a country you have traveled to and begin uploading your photos from your trip to that country. 
      <p> 
        As described above, the home page will have an interactive map because the plan is to have this as a starting point for the visitors. The interactive features I hope to have on the map include a hover effect with shadow (similar to what was done on the white-water rafting home page). Additionally, there needs to be a link to connect the country the visitor clicks on to another page where they can choose the layout for the photos from the trip to that country.
      </p>
      <p>  
        People may want to visit my site because it is a fun and creative way to organize and reflect on past trips. Oftentimes, when you are looking through photos it is challenging to find the ones you are looking for. For those who like looking back on past trips and seeing the places they have been, this website will be an easier alternative. Instead of endless scrolling, the layout of the home page will have an interactive map displaying pinpoints depending on the places the user has traveled and ultimately uploaded photos. Having it organized this way will save the user a lot of time.   
        As such, visitors can expect the site to provide a fun and creative way to organize photos from past trips.

      </ul>
      <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>
      <p>
      <p>
        Time to relive your trip! Change the settings to change how the photos are displayed. Once you have started 2+ projects, all the countries you have uploaded photos to will appear on the side. At any point click on the country icon to view those photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page will be accessible by clicking on a country on the map. The layout of this page will be simple most likely the photos will appear in a gallery style. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several activities the user will get to complete on this site.   
        First of all, they will be able to upload their personal photos (of their choosing). Additionally, by clicking on the interactive map, they will be able to select specific photos from a trip and upload them based on the corresponding country. Once, the visitor attaches these photos to a specific country they can choose how they want it to be displayed on a child page.

      </ul>
      <h3>Memories</h3>
      <p>
      <p>
        Time to record your adventures! Attach your unique stories from your travels for each country youâ€™ve been to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This page will be accessible from the home screen. In addition to attaching photos to specific countries, you can also attach memories or stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given these activities, visitors will need it to be clear where and how to upload photos. As far as information I will need to know, I need to look into how I can include an interactive map with proper navigation. Additionally, I will need to know how I can allow the visitor to upload their personal photos instead of just having mine. Lastly, I will need to know how I can allow them to choose between templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitors will come to my site instead of others because, to my knowledge, there is not necessarily something similar to my idea out there. Additionally, my goal is to allow people to be creative, but not have to do as much work to make their personalized website look aesthetically pleasing. This will be accomplishable through the various design templates the visitors have to choose from.
