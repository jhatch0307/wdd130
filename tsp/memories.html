                    <h3>Mexico</h3>
                    <p>My family has been to Mexico countless amounts of times. Typically we stick to our usual routine of going to the beach and eating tacos. However, on this particular occasion, we decided to branch out and go on what we thought would be a pleasant, easy breezy hike. This hike turned out to be pleasant (except for during the incline) and was indeed brief. Unfortunately, due to the briefness, there were several steep parts. Needless to say, not everyone was smiling during that part, but the view made all the tears worth it. </p>

                    <p>Let me start off by saying I'm not a morning person and my sister is definetly not a morning person. However, this didn't stop us from waking up before the sun rose to visit Trevi Fountain without the crowds of people. This was the first of many adventures we had in Italy. </p>

                    <h3>Turkey</h3>
                    <p>One summer, I had the opportunity to travel with two cousins to visit their dad in Turkey. We did many amazing things, but my favorit part of the trip was our coastal cruise. We spent 3 nights on a private ship with a personal crew. This picture was taken at one of our resting spots as the sun was begining to go down.</p>
