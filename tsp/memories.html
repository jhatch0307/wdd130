                    <h3>Mexico</h3>
                    <p>My family has been to Mexico countless amounts of times. Typically we stick to our usual routine of going to the beach and eating tacos. However, on this particular occasion, we decided to branch out and go on what we thought would be a pleasant, easy breezy hike. </p>

                    <p>Anyone who has traveled internationally, laughs at the idea of getting any sleep on the plane. Nonetheless, we fought our jetlag and went to see the Altar of the Fatherland. Ater climbing the many stairs, looking at the gorgeous landscape and busy streets was a sureal moment for someone who has been dying to go to Italy their whole life.   </p>

                    <h3>Turkey</h3>
                    <p>One summer, I had the opportunity to travel with two cousins to visit their dad in Turkey. We did many amazing things, but my favorit part of the trip was our coastal cruise. We spent 3 nights on a private ship with a personal crew. This picture was taken at one of our resting spots as the sun was begining to go down.</p>
